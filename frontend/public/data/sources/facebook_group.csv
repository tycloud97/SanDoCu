1845831469389422,"WEATHER UPDATE (Nov 3rd): TYPHOON KALMAEGI CHANGES COURSE, INTENSIFIES TO DANGEROUS CATEGORY 14! According to the Nation","WEATHER UPDATE (Nov 3rd): TYPHOON KALMAEGI CHANGES COURSE, INTENSIFIES TO DANGEROUS CATEGORY 14! According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF), Typhoon KALMAEGI is accelerating towards the East Sea (Biển Đông). As of 7:00 AM on November 3rd, the typhoon's center was holding Force 11, gusting to 15, and has shifted its course to West-Southwest, moving quickly at 25km/h. Forecasts indicate the typhoon will continue to change direction towards West-Northwest, and around 7:00 AM on November 5th, it will enter the East Sea, officially becoming Typhoon No. 13. Most alarming: by 7:00 AM on November 6th, the typhoon is likely to intensify to a catastrophic Force 14, gusting to 17, situated about 430km East-Southeast of Gia Lai province's coastline. A Level 4 Disaster Risk Warning has been issued for the central East Sea (including the Trường Sa archipelago), signaling extreme danger at sea. Meanwhile, the Central region is enduring historic rainfall. The NCHMF reports that in the past 24 hours (ending 10:00 AM on November 3rd), record rainfall levels were recorded: Bà Nà (Da Nang) at 514.2mm and Hương Sơn (Hue City) at 502.8mm. The torrential rain persists, and over the next 3-6 hours, accumulated rainfall in Hue City and Da Nang City could still reach 60-100mm, with some areas exceeding 200mm. The soil moisture model indicates that many areas in Ha Tinh, Quang Tri, Hue, Da Nang, and Quang Ngai have reached or are near saturation (over 85%), which significantly raises the risk of flash floods, landslides, and ground subsidence. Areas facing extremely high risks include: Hòa Vang, Hải Vân, Sơn Trà (Da Nang City); steep terrain areas in Ha Tinh (Hương Khê, Kỳ Anh), Quang Tri (Đakrông, Hướng Phùng), Hue City (A Lưới, Lộc An), and Quang Ngai (Sơn Tây, Tây Trà Bồng). Authorities and residents in all listed high-risk communes/wards must increase monitoring and be prepared for immediate evacuation as directed by local authorities. #TyphoonKalmaegi #DaNangAlert #FloodWarning #SevereWeather #DaNang365 #DN365 #DaNang #ExpatsinDaNang #Vietnam #TravelVietnam #LifeinVietnam #ExploreVietnam CREDIT: Trung tâm DBKTTVQG",,,,https://www.facebook.com/groups/152330905406162/posts/1845831469389422/,https://scontent.fdad3-6.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/453257063_1011899130937942_8725446799304593519_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_s80x80_tt6&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=2d3e12&_nc_ohc=ZK33RawoHb4Q7kNvwHqkDID&_nc_oc=AdkpYkN0k72zZuTlXQBECEagLnZ1T-YsnoXtzTKoZYSj16a9SIb_lPragsXCcPP4NYk1ILnHzn7YTpA6hRmTiZZu&_nc_zt=24&_nc_ht=scontent.fdad3-6.fna&_nc_gid=OH6nPwHX-I4FeSb70Zsv0A&oh=00_Afi-4bTDWE9rJanZ7CCxsVSeNQiicGRl062RJ9DD1aKzYg&oe=690E94B9,2025-11-03T23:53:46

As river levels in Da Nang surged back today (Nov 3rd), many low-lying neighborhoods in the ancient town have been submerged for the second time. People living along the Hoai River - on Bach Dang, Nguyen Thai Hoc, and Tran Phu streets - are struggling as floodwaters return. The An Hoi area and Hoi An Market are among the hardest hit, with some places over a meter deep. Locals are using boats to move belongings to higher ground once more. #HoiAnFlood #CentralVietnamFloods #HoiAnToday #DaNang #VietnamWeather #HoiAnAncientTown #FloodRelief #PrayForCentralVietnam #ExpatsInDaNang #VietnamNews #DaNang365",,,,https://www.facebook.com/groups/152330905406162/posts/1845630486076187/,https://scontent.fdad3-6.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/453257063_1011899130937942_8725446799304593519_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_s80x80_tt6&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=2d3e12&_nc_ohc=ZK33RawoHb4Q7kNvwHqkDID&_nc_oc=AdkpYkN0k72zZuTlXQBECEagLnZ1T-YsnoXtzTKoZYSj16a9SIb_lPragsXCcPP4NYk1ILnHzn7YTpA6hRmTiZZu&_nc_zt=24&_nc_ht=scontent.fdad3-6.fna&_nc_gid=rF4SVQsnFbpg-WaIuJYKaw&oh=00_AfgcpZBDCdWNVqHW8tFTFEVh1fyNEAi6TWFzauaNvySDdw&oe=690E94B9,2025-11-03T23:54:03

The Dung Nham Castle: Rising from the cliffs with colossal stone faces and bold red towers, this castle feels straight out of a fantasy film, dramatic, mysterious, unforgettable. The Sun God Fountain (Thác Thần Mặt Trời): Golden horses galloping through sparkling streams of light — especially magical at sunset when the sky glows amber. Le Jardin d’Amour Flower Garden: A dreamscape of blooms where a giant sunflower goddess stands guard. Every corner is made for slow strolls, deep breaths, and endless photos.
